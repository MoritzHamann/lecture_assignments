Rotation, mirroring and generic permutation does not have effect or implecation on the marching squares algorithm for the computation of the isolines. This is because the isoline made up of piecewise linear segments going through a number of data points on the data grid. These data points are computed by linear interpolation between two nodes of a cell within the data grid. A change to the node order does not have any affect on the bilinear interpolation as long as the values on these nodes are still correctly associated with the coordinates of the node.
