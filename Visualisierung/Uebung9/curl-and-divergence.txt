The curl for a two dimensional vectorfield is defined as

    curl(F(x,y)) = dFy/dx - dFx/dy

therefore the curl for the given vektorfield is

    curl(F(x,y)) = alpha - (-1) = alpha+1
    curl(F(x,y)) = -1   for alpha = -2

which means the curl at every point of the vectorfield is equal.


The divergence of a two dimensional vectorfield is defined as

    div(F(x,y)) = dFx/dx + dFy/dy

therefore the divergence of the given vectorfield is

    div(F(x,y)) = 0 + 0 = 0
